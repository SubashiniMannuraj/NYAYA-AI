Workflow Architecture 

Transcription Processing 
- The user asks a legal question via voice input.  
- Speech Recognition converts speech into text for further processing.  

 Knowledge Graph Integration 
- The Knowledge Graph organizes legal information into relational entities.  
- It helps in structuring the query and improving retrieval accuracy.  

 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) & LLM Processing  
- RAG searches for relevant legal information from trusted sources and personalizes the response.  
- The query is processed by LLaMA or DeepSeek, which generates an initial legal answer.  

 Validation Layer  
- The generated response is validated by DeepSeek AI or Ollama, ensuring legal accuracy.  
- If required, the response is reprocessed by the LLaMA model** for enhanced clarity and correctness.  

  Transcription Conversion  
- The final validated response is converted back into speech output, making it accessible even to non-literate users.
