# Multilingual Legal Aid Voice Assistant

## Overview

This repository contains a minimum viable product (MVP) for a multilingual legal aid voice assistant. The system integrates the following components:
- **Speech-to-Text & Multilingual Translation:** Converts spoken language into text, translates between multiple languages, and converts text back to speech.
- **Knowledge Graph & Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Extracts text from legal documents, indexes the data with FAISS, builds a Neo4j knowledge graph, and uses an LLM for generating legal aid responses.

The overall workflow is designed as:  
**Speech → Text → RAG (Personalized Data) → LLM (Validation) → LLM/DeepSeek (Response Generation) → Speech**  

For the MVP, the modules have been implemented separately:
- **Module A:** Voice recognition and multilingual translation.
- **Module B:** Knowledge graph-based RAG and LLM response generation.

## Workflow

### 1. Speech-to-Text & Multilingual Translation Module
- **Speech Recognition:** Uses the `speech_recognition` library to capture and transcribe audio.
- **Translation & Speech Synthesis:** Uses `googletrans` for language translation and `gTTS` for text-to-speech conversion.
- **GUI Interface:** Built with `tkinter` and audio playback managed by `pygame`.

### 2. Knowledge Graph and RAG Module
- **PDF Text Extraction:** Utilizes `PyPDF2` to extract text from PDFs.
- **Text Splitting:** Implements LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to break text into manageable chunks.
- **Embeddings & Indexing:** Generates embeddings using Hugging Face's `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` and indexes them with FAISS.
- **Knowledge Graph Construction:** Uses Neo4j and `py2neo` to store legal entities (e.g., Person, Object, Event, Step, OnlinePortal, ProcedureAfterApproach).
- **Response Generation:** Retrieves relevant data via a RAG pipeline and generates answers using the `deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm-7b-chat` model.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Neo4j Database ([Download Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download/))
- (Optional) Virtual Environment

### Required Python Packages

```bash
pip install speech_recognition googletrans==4.0.0-rc1 gTTS tkinter pygame PyPDF2 langchain faiss-cpu numpy transformers torch py2neo sentence-transformers
```

> **Note:** `tkinter` is often included by default with Python.

### Model & Data Setup
- **LLM Model:** Download and configure the `deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm-7b-chat` model as per provider instructions.
- **Neo4j:** Set up your Neo4j instance and update the connection parameters in the code (`NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USER`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`).

## Usage

### Running the Voice Recognition and Translation Module
Execute the script for the GUI:

```bash
python voice_translator.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to select languages and use the speech-to-text and text-to-speech features.

### Running the RAG and Legal Aid Module
Run the script that processes legal documents, builds the knowledge graph, and generates legal aid responses:

```bash
python legal_aid_rag.py
```

This script will:
- Extract text from PDFs.
- Generate embeddings and build a FAISS index.
- Populate a Neo4j knowledge graph.
- Retrieve data using RAG and generate responses via the LLM.

## Completed MVP Features

- **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Neo4j graph with entities such as Person, Object, Event, Step, OnlinePortal, and ProcedureAfterApproach.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Pipeline to retrieve and generate responses using indexed legal documents and an LLM.
- **Multilingual Voice Translation:** Standalone module for speech recognition, translation, and speech synthesis.

## Future Enhancements

- **End-to-End Integration:** Combine the modules into a seamless, fully integrated system.
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Improve robustness for real-time processing.
- **UI Improvements:** Further refine the user interface.
- **Scalability:** Optimize for handling larger datasets and more languages.
